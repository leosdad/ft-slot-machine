# Slot machine game with fischertechnik and Arduino Mega

![Close-up of the reels (without covers)](docs/reels.jpg)

This project is heavily inspired by [Hypervisual Century](http://hypervisual.com/century/), a software slots machine game that I developed as a demo for my company back in 1998. From it I've taken the symbol graphics and the lock reels feature, among other ideas.

There are several reference images, diagrams and spreadsheets in the [docs](/docs) folder.
